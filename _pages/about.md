My name is Diwei Zou (ÈÇπËø™ÁéÆ), and I come from Hubei Province. I am a senior undergraduate student at [Hongyi Honor College](https://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), where I am majoring in Microelectronics Science and Engineering. I am now doing my final year project in [Division of Quantum Physics and Quantum Information](https://quantum.ustc.edu.cn/web/), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). My research interests revolve around NV Center in Diamond, Quantum Information, Quantum Sensing, and Density Functional Theory.

During my leisure time, I actively participate as a member of the Wuhan University Symphony Orchestra, where I play percussion instruments. I have had the privilege of performing in numerous concerts both on and off campus. Additionally, I am an enthusiastic cycling enthusiast. If you're interested, you can check out my cycling activities on my [Strava Account](https://www.strava.com/athletes/95558291), and feel free to join me for a ride anytime. üòâ

- Learned about properties of NV center in diamond for quantum applications.
-	Learned about properties of density-functional theory based on first principles and its application in simulation of NV center, as well as relative software (VASP, PWmat).
-	Created different kinds of crystal configurations and explored their influences on the electronic and optical properties of NV center, and proved the phosphorus donor could keep the functionality of NV center.
-	Explored non-local excitation mechanism between the NV center and the phosphorus donor (both the one-photon and two-photon ways) and showed the phosphorus donor could enhance the stability of NV-, compared with nitrogen donor.
-	Complete the simulation work and writing an academic paper ‚ÄúInfluence of phosphorus donor on the NV center: A first-principles study‚Äù. This paper has been submitted to Diamond and Related Materials, which is now under review.

## Research on the diamond surface with NV centers

> 
> **Institute**: [The Institute of Technological Sciences, Wuhan University](https://technology.whu.edu.cn/index.htm)
> 
> **Time**: May 2023 - now, underway

-	Learned about properties of the diamond surface used for creating NV center and enhancing performance in quantum applications.
-	Repeated the work conducted by my adviser (Assoc. Prof. Wei Shen), collected and organized data for the paper: [Shen, Wei, et al. "Fluorine-terminated diamond (110) surfaces for nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors." Carbon 193 (2022): 17-25](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.02.017).
-	Learned the migration of the vacancy towards the nitrogen when creating NV centers and figured out the energies in transition states to prove the mechanism of preparing the NV center with high temperature annealing (recent work).
-	Proposed an idea about surface charge transfer doping method to create n-type diamond surface for quantum sensor based on the NV center. I am now establishing simulation models to verify my guess and finding possible breakthroughs for further research.
