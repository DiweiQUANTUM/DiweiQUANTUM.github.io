My name is Diwei Zou (ÈÇπËø™ÁéÆ), and I come from Hubei Province. I am a senior undergraduate student at [Hongyi Honor College](https://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), where I am majoring in Microelectronics Science and Engineering. I am now doing my final year project in [Division of Quantum Physics and Quantum Information](https://quantum.ustc.edu.cn/web/), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). My research interests revolve around NV Center in Diamond, Quantum Information, Quantum Sensing, and Density Functional Theory.

During my leisure time, I actively participate as a member of the Wuhan University Symphony Orchestra, where I play percussion instruments. I have had the privilege of performing in numerous concerts both on and off campus. Additionally, I am an enthusiastic cycling enthusiast. If you're interested, you can check out my cycling activities on my [Strava Account](https://www.strava.com/athletes/95558291), and feel free to join me for a ride anytime. üòâ

- Learned about properties of NV center in diamond for quantum applications.
-	Learned about properties of density-functional theory based on first principles and its application in simulation of NV center, as well as relative software (VASP, PWmat).
-	Created different kinds of crystal configurations and explored their influences on the electronic and optical properties of NV center, and proved the phosphorus donor could keep the functionality of NV center.
-	Explored non-local excitation mechanism between the NV center and the phosphorus donor (both the one-photon and two-photon ways) and showed the phosphorus donor could enhance the stability of NV-, compared with nitrogen donor.
-	Complete the simulation work and writing an academic paper ‚ÄúInfluence of phosphorus donor on the NV center: A first-principles study‚Äù. This paper has been submitted to Diamond and Related Materials, which is now under review.


Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

------
More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
