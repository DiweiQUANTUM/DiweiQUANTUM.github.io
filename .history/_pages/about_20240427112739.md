My name is Diwei Zou (邹迪玮), and I come from Hubei Province. I am a senior undergraduate student at [Hongyi Honor College](https://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), where I am majoring in Microelectronics Science and Engineering. I am now doing my final year project as a visiting internship in [Division of Quantum Physics and Quantum Information (QPQI)](https://quantum.ustc.edu.cn/web/), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I have accepted the conditional offer of the PhD program in the [Department of Physics](http://physics.ust.hk/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST, Clear Water Bay)](https://hkust.edu.hk/). My research interests revolve around Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) Center in Diamond, Quantum Information, and Density Functional Theory.

During my leisure time, I actively participate as a member of the Wuhan University Symphony Orchestra, where I play percussion instruments. I have had the privilege of performing in numerous concerts both on and off campus. Additionally, I am an enthusiastic cycling enthusiast. If you're interested, you can check out my cycling activities on my [Strava Account](https://www.strava.com/athletes/95558291), and feel free to join me for a ride anytime. 😉
