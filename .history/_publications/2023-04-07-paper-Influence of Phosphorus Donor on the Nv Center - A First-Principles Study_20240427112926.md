## Abstract
The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a point defect in diamond that can be used as a quantum sensor and emitter. To utilize its electronic and optical properties, it needs to maintain a negative charge state, but how to enhance the negative charge stability and avoid becoming the “dark state” have been challenges for many scientists. In this study, we introduced phosphorus atoms as donor elements to provide extra electrons to the NV center to keep its negative charge state through theoretical simulation. We used density functional theory to investigate the electronic and optical properties of the NV center with phosphorus donor in different configurations and confirmed that the NV center with phosphorus donor could retain its original properties required as a quantum bit. Moreover, in the non-local excitation processes, both in the one-photon and two-photon approaches, the NV center with phosphorus donor had higher resistance to charge conversion (from NV- to NV0) and the “photo-blinking” phenomenon than the NV center with nitrogen donor. Our results suggest that phosphorus can be a promising donor element for improving the stability and functionality of the NV center in quantum applications.
